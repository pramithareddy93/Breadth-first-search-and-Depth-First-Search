Task 1A

BFS
          Step 1: Start by putting any one of the graph’s vertices at the back of the queue.
          Step 2: Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
          Step 3: Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited 
          list to the rear of the queue.
          Step 4: Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.





Task1 b

DFS –
        Step 1: Declare a queue and insert the starting Vertex.
        Step 2: Initialize a visited array and mark the starting Vertex as visited.
        Step3: Remove the First vertex of queue.
        Step 4: Mark that vertex as visited
        Step 5: Insert all the unvisited neighbors of the vertex into queue.
        Step 6: stop.
